## Instructions:

- Read each and every line of question carefully, missing any functionality which was asked will reduce your overall marks.
- Use **React** for frontend.
- Use **Chakra UI** or **MUI** as UI library (optional).
- Use **Node, Express, Mongo (NEM)** as backend.

## Problem Statement:

The task is to create a small Full-Stack web application, where users can create and share recipes. The frontend of the app should be implemented using React, and Node, Express, Mongo (NEM) as the backend.

### Frontend:

Your app should have a navbar with the following routes:

- Create Recipe
- Browse Recipes

### Create Recipe:

The Create Recipe page should have a form with the following fields:

- Recipe Name
- Category (select tag with Starters, Main Course and Desserts as options)
- Ingredients (a textarea where users can enter a list of ingredients)
- Instructions (a textarea where users can enter instructions for the recipe)
- Price

On form submit, store the recipe data in your backend.

### Browse Recipes:

- The Browse Recipes page should render all the submitted recipes as cards, displaying the recipe name, ingredients, and instructions.
- There should be a "Delete" button appended to each card, which, when clicked, deletes the specific recipe from the backend as well as from the UI.
- The user should be able to filter the recipes based on category (Starters, Main Course and Desserts), and the functionality should be implemented using backend APIs.
- The user should be able to sort the recipes based on price. (Ascending and Descending)
- Both the filter and sort functionalities should work together seamlessly and should be implemented through Backend APIs. (Implementing these functionalities in the frontend won't be considered)

### Backend:

- Create the following API’s
    - Post API
    - Retrieve API
    - Delete API
    - Filter Data
    - Sort Data
